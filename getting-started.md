# How to start meet.js <Cityname>

[wersja polska](getting-started-PL.md)

## Get in touch

Send an email to contact@meetjs.pl and tell us where you want to start your meet.js chapter.
Try to get an idea of the number of people in your city interested in JS/CSS

## Conditions

meet.js is a non-commercial recurring event for people interested in JS and Front-end in general.

You only need to fulfill the conditions necessary to fulfill that sentence above.

- First and foremost: meet.js belongs to the community and cannot be organized for profit nor by a company. Local meet.js organizer can only be a person and they should not get paid to organize meet.js.
*Obviously, we use the help of sponsors on regular basis. IT's just that we call them sponsors,partners or hosts, but never the organizers of a meet.js event.
- A local meet.js is supposed to be recurring, not a one-time event.
- Local organizers are welcome to join the communication across cities and be open to participating in it.
- Local organizers use the meet.js brand correctly (logo remains the same, no changes to colors, reuse existing designs)

## First steps

After you get in touch, before you can organize your first meet.js, there's a few things to get done first:

- get added to github, slack and FB
- set up a README in your city's github repo in the meetjspl org
- find a communication channel for your local community - other than our main FB page and github - eg. mailing list or meetup.com
- find a venue for your first event
